Social Login Buttons
==

All of these are buttons I've had to create.  I'm not the greatest graphic designer, so feel 
free to improve on my designs if you wish. 

Currently there are login-buttons for 
 - Facebook
 - Github
 - Google (Plus)
 - Instagram
 - LinkedIn
 - Twitter

The font is Helvetica Nueue. It came free on my Mac, I believe, but I will likely switch it
out to a more open font when I get the time.
